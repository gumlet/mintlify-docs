### Video Privacy

Add the privacy settings to your videos to make them available to a limited set of users.

#### Public

By default, all videos uploaded to Gumlet are public. These videos are indexable and searchable through Google search engine and others. We add seo metadata to your webpage when a video is embedded.

#### Password Protected

Add a password to showcase the videos to a limited set of users. Your audience can only access the video if they have the correct password. You can change or remove the password as and when required.

#### Unlisted

Only people with the correct video URL have access to it. The private videos are not indexed on search engines.

#### Private

The private videos do not play outside the dashboard and private video channels. You can create a member-only channel and mark your videos private to secure your content from playing outside your channels.

### Replace Video

You can replace the video content without actually changing the video URL. Your title, description, tags, and other settings remain intact except the subtitles (if generated), and thumbnail.

In some cases, the video is not available to download, because the video was not stored with Gumlet as per your processing settings. If you want to change this setting, contact our chat support. *Note: Only newly uploaded videos will be downloadable after changing the settings.*

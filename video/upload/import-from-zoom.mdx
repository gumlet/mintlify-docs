Add Zoom as a source in your collection. All the new recordings will be optimized and added to your collection.

### Create a Zoom source

Navigate to the [create collection](https://dashboard.gumlet.com/video/collections/add) page and select Zoom as the Origin Type.

### Generate a Secret Token

You need to generate a secret token from your Zoom account. Here is the step-wise guide to generate a secret token in your Zoom account and get recordings whenever finished.

#### Create a Zoom App

Go to the [Zoom App Creation](https://marketplace.zoom.us/develop/create) page and create a **Webhook Only** app.

Once you fill in the important details for the app, you need to set up permissions to send events to Gumlet.

Copy the Secret Token from the above screen and add it to the Collection settings in Gumlet [here](/docs/zoom-recordings-as-source#create-zoom-source).

#### Subscribe to Recordings Completed Event

Click on the **Add Event Subscription** button and add the endpoint URL as `https://api.gumlet.com/v1/video/assets/zoom/event/{collection_id}`, replace `{collection_id}` with the actual collection ID from your [dashboard](https://dashboard.gumlet.com/video/collections).

Click the **Validate** button to confirm the URL is correct.

Click the **Add Events** button to select the required event to share the recording information with Gumlet.

Save the settings and **Continue**. Your app is activated now. All new recordings will now be processed to Gumlet automatically.

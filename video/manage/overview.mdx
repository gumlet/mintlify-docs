Gumlet is built to improve user experience and engage your users. For you to get started quickly, we have created a Video Library (content management system) to manage all assets via a simple web interface. You can head to the [video library](https://dashboard.gumlet.com/video/manage/) section, and you will see this screen:

### Switching Collections

We allow users to create multiple collections to manage their content efficiently. You can create more collections from the top-right corner of the Library or switch to a different collection.

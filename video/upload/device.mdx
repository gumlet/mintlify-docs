Uploading your original files to Gumlet is the easiest way to get started using Gumlet. When you do this, we store the original input file and all output files.

## Add files

Drag and drop files in the upload box, or choose **My Device**. Upload should start automatically and you can monitor the progress.

> Please note, there is no limit on file size but files which are not video / audio will result in processing error and will be deleted.

### Original file

The files you upload are stored in their original form without any modifications. You always have the option to download the original file if you ever want. For streaming, this original version is never used. We process video and then we use the optimized and processed version for streaming which helps reduce streaming bandwidth.

If you ever delete the video from Gumlet, its original input file and all output files are deleted after 30 days. If you have any deletion by mistake, you have up to 30 days to request for restoration.

Have you been using Wistia to host and manage your videos? We have got a quick way to import all the videos to Gumlet.

Prerequisites:

* A paid account with Gumlet (if not, you can subscribe to a plan [here](https://dashboard.gumlet.com/organization/billing?utm_source=docs\&utm_campaign=vimeo-migration))

Now head over to [Import Page](https://dashboard.gumlet.com/video/import-videos). You will find Wistia and click on connect, and you will need an API token from Wistia to import your videos.

### Select a Profile

Select a profile to process your imported videos. All the files will be imported and processed automatically based on the selected Video Profile.

### Select a Destination

The destination is where all your imported videos will be stored. This is the same as the collection. Select a collection from the list, and we will process and keep your videos in the selected collection.

### Select Projects

Select projects that you want to import to Gumlet. We will automatically create playlists and organize your files.

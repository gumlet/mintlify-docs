Have you been using Vimeo to host and manage your videos? We have got a quick way to import all the videos to Gumlet.

Prerequisites:

* An active Vimeo Standard and higher or Vimeo Pro or higher plan
* A paid account with Gumlet (if not, you can subscribe to a plan [here](https://dashboard.gumlet.com/organization/billing?utm_source=docs\&utm_campaign=vimeo-migration))

Now head over to [Import Page](https://dashboard.gumlet.com/video/import-videos). You will find Vimeo and click on connect.

![Import Page](/images/docs/192879545a2a35d801778c832d3ed7a2a80c646541dea7ac6ae900326a83bcc6-Screenshot_at_Sep_23_12-25-51.png)

## Authorize Vimeo Account

On clicking the `Connect`button, you will be redirected to the Vimeo Authorization page, where you need to click on `Allow` button.

## Final Steps to Import

Once the token is verified, you can preview which folders and videos are there to import.

![Select files and folders to import](/images/docs/69825671da9cab6dd6128cc42809eeb10126f5454143b7fc947a8a6307e8044c-Screenshot_2024-09-23_at_2.22.35_PM.png)

### Select a Profile

Select a profile to process your imported videos. All the files will be imported and processed automatically based on the selected Video Profile.

### Select a Destination

The destination is where all your imported videos will be stored. This is the same as the collection. Select a collection from the list, and we will process and keep your videos in the selected collection.

### Select Files & Folders

Select files and folders that you want to import to Gumlet. We will automatically create folders and move files to corresponding folders.

Clicking the **Import Videos** button will start the Import.

Sit back and relax. We will do all the heavy work to import and process videos for you.

You will find all your Imported Videos in the selected collection.

## Update Embed Code

All your videos are imported to Gumlet. If you use Vimeo Embeds, you must replace your URL prefix with a Gumlet prefix to support the same URL structure to play your videos directly.

The Vimeo Embed URL looks like `https://player.vimeo.com/video/831802811`

Replace `https://player.vimeo.com/video` with `https://vimeo.gumlet.io/embed`

Your new URL will be like `https://vimeo.gumlet.io/embed/831802811`

Happy Streaming.

<Warning>
  Vimeo doesn not allow us to download videos via API for free plan users.

### Search by Title or asset\_id
You can search files via a`title` or `asset_id` and you will find it.

### Filter by Tags
You can filter your videos with the tags that you assigned to them.

### Filter by Status
Naturally, we show all the videos that your collection holds. You can filter them based on status like.`Ready`, `Processing`, etc.

### Using APIs
All the actions possible through the dashboard are also available via REST APIs. You can check [List Assets](/reference/list-assets) API for details.

## Tags

Use Tags to categorize your videos based on events, dates, and teams. A video can have multiple tags.

### Adding a tag

1. Select the video(s) to which you want to add the tag(s).
2. Click on `Edit tags` on the top panel.
3. Add tags and Save.

P.S. - You can create as many tags as you want and tag videos.

### An alternate way to add/remove tags

You can also add or remove a tag for a video on the [Video Settings](/docs/video-settings) page.
